            >Welcome to our school's online administration platform! This
            website has been designed to provide our administrators with an
            easy-to-use tool for managing courses, grades, and calculating GPAs
            for our students. As an administrator, you will have access to all
            of the features you need to ensure that our students are receiving
            the best education possible.
            <br />
            Courses: Using this website, you will be able to create and manage
            all of the courses offered at our school. You can add new courses,
            modify existing ones, and even delete courses that are no longer
            offered. This makes it easy to keep our course offerings up to date
            and relevant to our students' needs.
            <br />
            Grades: You will also be able to manage grades for all of our
            students using this platform. You can input grades for individual
            assignments, as well as overall grades for each course. This ensures
            that our students are receiving accurate and up-to-date feedback on
            their progress throughout the semester.
            <br />
            GPA Calculation: One of the most important features of this website
            is its ability to calculate GPAs for our students. This means that
            you can easily determine each student's overall GPA, as well as
            their GPA for individual courses. This makes it easy to identify
            students who may need additional support, as well as those who are
            excelling in their studies.
            <br />
            We understand that managing courses, grades, and GPAs can be a
            complex and time-consuming process. That's why we have designed this
            website to be as user-friendly as possible. You will find that the
            interface is easy to navigate, with clear and intuitive controls for
            each of the features you need to use.
            <br />
            If you have any questions or concerns about using this website,
            please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. We are here
            to help you get the most out of this powerful tool, and we look
            forward to working with you to ensure that our students receive the
            best education possible.</h3
